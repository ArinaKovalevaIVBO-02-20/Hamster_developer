                        Hello, world! I'm Oliverindo, today we have a Python development course. We will run your first program together, "Hello, hamster". We click on the PyCharm icon with our paws. To be honest, it takes me more effort to click the mouse button because my weight doesn't allow me to do it easily...

                    <div class="second-text">
                        <p>Next, we write print("Hello, Hamster!") and press the green triangle, which will run our program. Done! Now you are a real hamster-developer! I plan to write the next program, which is a nut calculator. If you have any ideas on how to do it, please tell me because my owner ignores me... By the way, he is also a big hamster-developer. I learn from him, sometimes when he is not at the computer, I open his programs and study them, and sometimes make edits.</p>
                        <p>Now I am working on writing a nut calculator. So, here's what we do: we need a variable for nuts. Let's call it "number of nuts". So, let's create two more variables: the number of nuts in the right cheek and the number of nuts in the left cheek, we will enter them manually. We add these variables together and get the number of nuts we stole. What did I forget? Oh yes, we need to output how many nuts we have in the end. I will share the code later, maybe. I'm very happy with the work done, today is a productive day! What do you think about the next program? Write me your suggestions!</p>
